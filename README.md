# Face recongition
The system consists of three parts, the first part is face detection, the second part is face recognition, the third part is face verification.
Face detection part is made up of Harris detector and sliding boxs.
Face recognition part is composed of 8 layers of convolutional neural network.
Face verification part is composed of a seven-layer convolutional neural network and a Siamese network.
